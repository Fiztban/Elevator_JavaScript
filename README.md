Learning JS making an elevator system in console

At the moment the system automatically creates a building with specified amounts of floors and basement levels, places the lift at a random location and determines a random amount of people wishing to go either up or down at any given floor.

There are commands to take people based on the direction of the elevator and to move the elevator but it isn't automated.

Currently working on deciding the logic of selection of optimal movement for the elevator.
